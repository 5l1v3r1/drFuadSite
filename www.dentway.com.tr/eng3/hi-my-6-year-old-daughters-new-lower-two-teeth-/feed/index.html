	Hi, my 6 year old daughter’s new lower two teeth are erupted but the previous teeth are still there. Later on we extracted those two and the new teeth came their place. But now the next 2 new teeth are coming and the previous 2 are still there. The same thing will happen for every time? Will she suffer from pain during eruption ? Is there another method for this situation ? Thank you. yazısına yapılan yorumlar	</title>

	Hi, i live in Giresun and i’m writing to you because i heard very good things about your clinic. I want to cover my all teeth with zirconia or with a more aesthetic material. Additionally, two teeth in my mouth are overlapping and i am very disturbed from this. What is the shortest way to fix them? Thanks already. yazısına yapılan yorumlar	</title>
